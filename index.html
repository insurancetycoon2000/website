    <p>Welcome to Insurance Tycoon 2000! This page is currently under construction.</p>
    <p>Insurance Tycoon is an open-source insurance management simulation game. You are the CEO of an insurance company, and the goal is to indemnify your customers while protecting the solvency of your enterprise. It is your choice as to whether your company remains a grassroots regional firm, or grows into an international conglomerate. </p>
    
    <p>However, your task will not be easy. Everywhere you look, competitors will try to crush you. Incumbents will undercut you in price. Insuretechs will be looking to disrupt you. Will your company stand the test of time?</p>
